# Get start Image Classification with TensorFlow
## This project is beginer guild to implementing deep learning with TensorFlow for binary classification. 
There are two sessions. First is build CNN amd Second is using Transfer learning. <br>

## First session: build Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
build CNN notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/code/kiattiphumsuwanarsa/image-classify-dog-cat

### table of context in this notebook are
* load data with ImageDataGenerator
* build CNN where activation function last is sigmoid
* sloving overfitting with Data augmentation

## Second session: Transfer learning
Transfer learning notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/code/kiattiphumsuwanarsa/transfer-learning-classify-dog-cat

### table of context in this notebook are
* load data with ImageDataGenerator
* download trained model weidgt from 'imagenet'
* set the activation function in the last layer to sigmoid.
